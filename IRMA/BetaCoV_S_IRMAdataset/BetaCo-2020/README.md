Sequence data, associated metadata, and accession list of seqs was downloaded from NCBI virus variation tool on 06/05/2020 for the taxon querie "betacornavirus" 

Data was organized by betacornaivirus strain/linage, R script used to extract metadata rows with matching strain name.


Sequences that were too short, lab isolates, or antigen/vaccine material were removed and can be found in file : betacoronavirus-ncbi.xlxs
SARS-COV-2 sequences were removed and can be found in tab 2 of betacoronavirus-ncbi.xlsx


GeoBoost v 1.1 was used to web-scrape metadata for all remaining  accessions for betacorniviruses.

R script used to create subsets of betacornavirus based on following:
	S gene
	Major virus groups:
		Middle Eastern
		OC43
		Bovine coronavirus
		Bat coronavirus
		SARS
		
	Minor virus groups:
		Hedgehog
		Dromedary camel
		Deer
		Waterbuck
		Murine
		Giraffe
		Antelope
